# The-Knapsack-Problem-Dynamic-programming
The **knapsack problem** is a problem in combinatorial optimization: <br />
Given a set of items, each with a mass and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

the input is in this format: <br />
C <br />
n <br />
O1 V1 P1 <br />
O2 V1 P1 <br />
... ... ... <br />
On Vn Pn <br />

Where **C** is the maximum backpack capacity in kg, **n** the number of items, **Oi** the name of object, **Vi** the value, **Pi** the weight. Example:<br />

20 <br />
5 <br />
anel 15 1 <br />
picasso 10 9 <br />
bosewave 8 3 <br />
ronaldo 5 4 <br />
vaso 9 6 <br />

The Output of this example is 42 which is the best amount os values in 20 KG of capacity.
